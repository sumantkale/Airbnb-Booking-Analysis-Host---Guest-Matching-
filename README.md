# Airbnb-Booking-Analysis-Host---Guest-Matching-
My Airbnb dataset project hosted on GitHub, exploring insights and analysis on the hospitality industry - Check out the code and findings here!
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more. This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values. Explore and analyze the data to discover key understandings such as :

1.Are private rooms preferred over other room types ?

2.Is Manhattan neighbourhood more preferred over other neighbourhood ?

3.What were you able to leran from the analysis?

4.Did your assumptions turn out to be right?

5.How would your analysis be helpful to the stakeholders?
